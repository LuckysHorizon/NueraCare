Below is a gentle overview of what each part of the report shows. I’ll keep the language simple and explain any medical terms that appear.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Complete Blood Count (CBC)\n\n| Test | Your Result | Normal Range | What it means |\n|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|\n| **Hemoglobin** | 13.2 g/dL | 13.0–17.0 g/dL | Your red‑blood‑cell level is within the normal range, so you’re not showing signs of anemia. |\n| **White Blood Cell (WBC) Count** | 7,800 cells/mm³ | 4,000–11,000 cells/mm³ | Your immune‑cell count is normal, indicating no obvious infection or inflammation at the time of the test. |\n| **Platelet Count** | 2.4 lakh cells/mm³ (240,000) | 1.5–4.5 lakh cells/mm³ | Platelets help blood clot. Your count is normal, so clotting ability is likely fine. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Blood Sugar Tests\n\n| Test | Your Result | Normal Range | What it means |\n|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|\n| **Fasting Blood Sugar** | 118 mg/dL | 70–100 mg/dL | Slightly above the normal fasting range. |\n| **Post‑Prandial (after a meal) Blood Sugar** | 162 mg/dL | <140 mg/dL | Above the normal range for after‑meal glucose. |\n| **HbA1c** | 6.4 % | 4.0–5.6 % | Reflects average blood sugar over the past 2–3 months. It’s higher than the normal range, indicating that blood sugar control could be a bit elevated. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Lipid Profile (Cholesterol & Triglycerides)\n\n| Test | Your Result | Normal Range | What it means |\n|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|\n| **Total Cholesterol** | 212 mg/dL | <200 mg/dL | Slightly above the ideal level. |\n| **LDL (“bad” cholesterol)** | 138 mg/dL | <130 mg/dL | A bit higher than recommended. |\n| **HDL (“good” cholesterol)** | 42 mg/dL | >40 mg/dL | Within the normal range. |\n| **Triglycerides** | 176"}

A value a bit higher can mean that blood sugar is a little above what is typical when you haven’t eaten for a while.\n- **Post‑Prandial Blood Sugar (162 mg/dL)** – The usual cut‑off is below 140 mg/dL. This shows that after a meal the blood sugar rises a bit more than expected.\n- **HbA1c (6.4 %)** – The normal range is 4.0‑5.6 %. This test reflects average blood sugar over the past few months, and a value just above the upper limit suggests that overall blood sugar has been slightly higher than normal.\n- **LDL Cholesterol (138 mg/dL)** – The target is below 130 mg/dL. A value a little higher indicates that the “bad” cholesterol is a touch above the preferred level.\n- **Triglycerides (176 mg/dL)** – The normal limit is under 150 mg/dL. This shows that the fat level in the blood is a bit higher than usual.\n- **SGOT (AST) (44 U/L)** – The normal range tops out at 40 U/L. A small increase can mean that the liver enzymes are a little higher than normal, which sometimes happens with mild liver stress or other conditions.\n- **Serum Creatinine (1.3 mg/dL)** – The normal range is 0.7‑1.2 mg/dL.

Blood Sugar Tests**\n- **Fasting blood sugar** is 118 mg/dL – a little above the normal fasting range (70–100).\n- **Post‑prandial (after a meal)** is 162 mg/dL – above the usual target of less than 140.\n- **HbA1c** (average blood sugar over the past 3 months) is 6.4 % – slightly higher than the normal range (4.0–5.6).\nThese values suggest that blood sugar control is a bit higher than ideal, but they are not yet in the high‑risk zone.\n\n**3. Lipid Profile**\n- **Total cholesterol** is 212 mg/dL – a touch above the preferred limit of less than 200.\n- **LDL (the “bad” cholesterol)** is 138 mg/dL – a little above the target of less than 130.\n- **HDL (the “good” cholesterol)** is 42 mg/dL – above the minimum of 40, which is good.\n- **Triglycerides** are 176 mg/dL – a bit higher than the desired less than 150.\nOverall, your cholesterol numbers are close to the upper side of normal, especially LDL and triglycerides.\n\n**4. Liver Function Test (LFT)**\n- **SGPT (ALT)** is 48 U/L – within the normal range (7–56).\n- **SGOT (AST)** is 44 U/L – slightly above the upper limit of 40, but still close to norm..."}
